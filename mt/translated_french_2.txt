&&& the senator Rivest hon.

&&& the senator Boudreau hon. 
&&& the hon. John Staunton perhaps Staunton ( chief the the l ( hon.

&&& in last analysis honourable who govern if the question is significantly sets why 
&&& will perhaps this the government the the canada or the Billy national the the Quebec why 
&&& the senator Boudreau hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable in the furthermore decision that she he justice honourable the Court Supreme he Grattan that the government the the canada he indeed a role the play in the modernization i 
&&& i i needless honourable yesterday night honourable this that the first minister had Syd the the period the the questions the the another criticism i 
&&& the elements the the proactive are yet the the consideration honourable as the first minister the he Grattan honourable however i am specifically that he Bryan knowing in detail the position the the government early that he will prepared the the do i

&&& the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable i remember the the minister that the Court Supreme no he Gerald nor judgment nor decision honourable that this was a simple educated honourable and that she no he given the guidelines the no government i 
&&& the Court Supreme he was react the if participatory on three questions eleventh in a referred the the government the the canada i 
&&& i remember also the the minister that the prince the Quebec he refused the if restricted before the Court Supreme and that this last he subsequently ConAgra a counsel the increases the prince i 
&&& instead the three questions honourable the courts he sixty " No. " i 
&&& unfortunately honourable the my notice honourable the Court Supreme he partisan outrepassé his reappointment in décidant the develop some lines guidelines regarding the question and the result honourable powers that they prior i 
&&& instead my notice honourable this he matching for indeed the légitimer the separation i 
&&& instead decline the the Court Supreme honourable because that she he established the the lines guidelines and the the consequently on the how how the somehow referendum should if dérouler and on this who should furthermore if the result no was not favourable the the canada honourable he is Gil for the first once legitimate the bluntly the the possibility the a separation i

&&& in this who concerns the decision the the Court Supreme honourable this is a question the educated i 
&&& the hon. senator Staunton perhaps Staunton he given his educated on the comments sir by the Court Supreme i

&&& the senator Lowell hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable i attempt the there answer i 
&&& i i was president the this committee during a starting or two he there he Marjorie a specifically time honourable and i i reprinted the Ruling the the during the this session i 
&&& the court the the senate does that there veterinary the thirteenth Main the the Estimates and the thirteenth additional the the Estimates the the committee referred Standing the the finance national i 
&&& since few early honourable because that the other committees privatization they repeating review the estimates cut for the departments how they if roles honourable we we god the withdraw the estimates cut the these departments Oprah the the reappointment the the committee referred Standing the the finance national i 
&&& i i consequently my colleagues the this question the the committee the another thanks and they if are interestingly the this delayed i 
&&& they uncovering two grounds honourable if i no i mistaken honourable and i can you tell that the the honourable expérimentés as the honourable Cools honourable Bolduc and Doody were everyone the indeed nays this delayed i 
&&& their first why honourable this is that the committee referred Standing the the finance national is the committee agenda the study the estimates cut and he bear therefore the removal these estimates globalement the our committee i 
&&& this according honourable they democracies that nothing no prevent a another committee Standing the obtaining the reappointment the the senate the if focus on the estimates cut for a parliament in specifically i 
&&& their sober prohibited was that honourable if we announcements for prior that obviously consideration by a another committee Standing the the estimates cut the the parliament how he if Feedlots must if do the the hospital the the reappointment the the committee referred Standing the the finance national honourable then this no would not possible i 
&&& a once my motion agreed honourable even with several amendments honourable the committee referred Standing the the agriculture and the the forestry honourable by g honourable no could not uncertainty a consideration the the estimates cut the the parliament the the Agriculture i 
&&& i think therefore that we no should not except that a committee Standing whatever occurs in nevertheless that this whatever the study in scrutiny the estimates cut the a parliament in specifically the the furthermore indeed that the estimates cut they was renvoyées globalement the the committee referred Standing the the finance national i 
&&& this could perhaps different if we thing take the the steps for this who is the approve the estimates cut including i 
&&& as the hon. senator the taxpayers honourable this no is not the indeed i 
&&& we nearly report on the estimates cut with our CHST the input and our recommendations honourable however we no we not undergo the approve these estimates cut in voting i 
&&& the senator Robichaud hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable i like explain the television the the amendment that i notwithstanding the the speaking the the president the the committee and the the members the the committee the the fisheries i 
&&& when the senator Lowell he proposed the adjournment the the resuming on the motion honourable i no i am not boundary since the senator Dan the he indeed i 
&&& however if i then honourable honourable honourable honourable i like you tell that the committee no does not creating the previous i 
&&& during the the first session the the last Thirty honourable the committee the the fisheries had duplication a orders the referred i 
&&& you you rappellerez that a motion had was participatory the statement indeed i 
&&& this is the moreover this that we we indeed honourable and the minister he Marg the committee the three again i 
&&& he would in the private the the senate that this committee if dealt on these esteemed and questionne the minister in the purpose the whether how he highlights all these CHST in due i 
&&& in this report yesterday the annual last honourable the seventeenth recommendation stipulait that the esteemed the the thirteenth the the parliament the the Fisheries and the the Oceans prior référés the the committee the the fisheries i 
&&& this report he was [ the 16 June the the unanimously by this hear i 
&&& this is therefore on this report and on this motion honourable who they was studied honourable that if basic the committee for abandon the consideration the the budget the the Estimates the the parliament the the Fisheries and the the Oceans i 
&&& i you ensures that he no is mention in the esteemed the the committee the the fisheries the empiéter on the reappointment the a another committee i 
&&& i think strongly and Japanese that our role would rather the you help honourable since if you you the applying the internal the all the departments honourable you no partner certainly not the time the do witness each the the ministers honourable their officials or counsel i 
&&& the committee he a shortly more the time for study the budget since he if ominously the a furthermore parliament i

&&& we we we well acquittés the this responsibility in acclaim the minister i 
&&& in round our report thus that a recommendation participatory the the unanimously honourable we quick everyone just abandon in the even vein i 
&&& the hon. Anne hepatitis i Cools hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable i like understand exactly this who if going here i 
&&& more earlier honourable the senator Lowell he according that he wanted placing the resuming and bluntly more later i

&&& he i apparently that few questions if lacking the we i 
&&& there could the congratulate in two Each honourable the much and the small i 
&&& the much question honourable as the he if well according the senator Lowell honourable this is the reappointment and the historically the the committee Standing referred the the finance national regarding the review the the budget the the Estimates honourable thus that the right that he this committee the right the islanders the entirety the this budget for his review i 
&&& i think that this that the senator Robichaud brothers in basically honourable this is the right or the power the a committee the ask a reappointment the the senate for study some appropriation who the whatever in the budget the the Estimates i

&&& i think understand honourable the the applying the the Sternly the the senator Tkachuk that honourable the his notice honourable a motion seventh the referred the the bill the bill he was agreed i 
&&& the third question is the whether if there he well acclaimed a member the the committee agenda the table the bill the bill honourable whatever the president honourable who no is not here and no could in do report honourable the respectfully perhaps president or a another member the the committee honourable in indeed honourable the sponsor the the bill the bill honourable the senator Payette perhaps Payette i 
&&& i no know not if this needless the the Christianity the the fractious or the the proceedings normal honourable however i pretend that No. i Lifelong member the the committee perhaps table a report the the put the the president honourable when the respectfully perhaps president is regrettably honourable even if there if awaiting reopening the this that the respectfully perhaps president define in the lack the the president i

&&& there i in he thereafter a copy i 
&&& the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton hon. 
&&& you suggested well the furthermore i 
&&& the senator Dan hon. 
&&& there there bedtime hon. 
&&& pursuant the the orders special proposed with the leave the the senate and [ the twenty November and notwithstanding the paragraph 97 ( 4 ( the the point honourable the bill the bill is now referred the the eighteenth referred Standing the the routine foreign i 
&&& i the i duplication in magnitude the the senate i 
&&& i think understand that this Martin the do in similarly that this position legislative whatever currently the how orderly honourable according the désirs the the senate i 
&&& i experiencing the watch the this that the bill the bill whatever g the the once by the committee the the banking and by similarly the the routine foreign in why the the questions who they was raised by the honourable preparation the the details the the bill the bill i 
&&& i no i pause however not on this question i 
&&& the hon. John Staunton perhaps Staunton ( chief the the l ( hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable the question is the whether if the there perhaps allow the a member the the committee the table a report without the request the the committee honourable if this is well the indeed honourable then that this report is approved by the committee i 
&&& the committee he god the do report the the bill the bill i 
&&& that i full honourable human no he Je the bill the report honourable perhaps perhaps perhaps even not the president nor the respectfully perhaps president i 
&&& by fairness the the fractious and by energy for their Indian honourable he would learned the the unless that they grab the report or in allow the disclosure i

&&& i request confirmation the these facts i 
&&& the senator Tkachuk hon. 
&&& No. honourable this no if is not indeed i 
&&& the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton hon. 
&&& second honourable i no notion not that we we enlisions in the privileges and i hopefully that we no subsequent not here a previous in interpret the bill the bill the more the a committee honourable however i no see not how the speaker perhaps perhaps Clement the removal the a committee the a another honourable the the step the the routine announcement honourable a report who no he even not was debated here i 
&&& i no see not the link that the Ruling perhaps do i 
&&& that there i takes if i i invite honourable however i supposais honourable after the two orders the resuming vessel the this question honourable that the report would tabled here and that the senate déciderait the his legalities i 
&&& he if ominously the a report Route the the senate and No. the the Ruling i 
&&& i know this that there stand by " orders special " i 
&&& there Norway honourable in transcript the resuming honourable that he is according just honourable as the senator Dan the he Jim the second thanks in rectifiant the the comments who no uncovering not was absolutely transcrits in the given Gerald official honourable that the question unfortunately perhaps express the a criticism honourable then the the another i 
&&& the proposition was that honourable for evil the a criticism the the another honourable he needless esteemed perhaps reconfirmé here i 
&&& the Ruling he frankly in our speaking honourable without explanation nor warning i 
&&& i i still reopening that honourable the the Paralympic the the given honourable this was the senate who décidait how he esteemed eighth the Sable the bill and the reports and where they eligible evil i 
&&& in this indeed perhaps drug honourable however honourable even if we quick that the report strictly the the committee the the routine foreign honourable this if is indeed without that the senate limitation his immediately the tell i 
&&& the senate no he never had the tributes the review the report nor the watch this that he there had nuances i 
&&& the senator Dan hon. 
&&& i like restricted a another comment the the about the the point the the point honourable and more particularly the the concern attitude by the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton honourable the whether if the bill the bill unfortunately back here before the perhaps referred the the committee the the routine foreign or evil the the committee the the routine foreign after that the committee the the banking in nine nothing with needless i 
&&& i no i not the Seneca exactly before too honourable however i think that the Ruling had advised this as reappointment tell that he vowed the first the the committee the the banking then that honourable a once that the committee the the banking in would nothing with needless honourable he vowed the the committee the the routine foreign i 
&&& we no we nothing according the more honourable and he is reasonable the interpret this as reappointment tell that he vowed direct the the committee the the routine foreign a once that the committee the the banking in would nothing with needless i 
&&& he is also possible the interpret this the the how the the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton i 
&&& the obviously tabling honourable i think whether that the committee the the routine foreign no he not crumbling his proceedings i 
&&& the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton does perhaps he add something something clarification the his counsel that the question whatever now shameful the the senate rather that the the committee the the routine foreign why 
&&& the senator Tkachuk hon. 
&&& his Hon. the speaker hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable i suppose that we ones the a point the the point honourable and everyone the everyone perhaps take the speaking regarding a point the the point i 
&&& the senator Tkachuk hon. 
&&& i no i not had the tributes the ask the the senator Vodrey honourable who as too is member the the committee president the the committee the the banking honourable if he tainted that the senator Payette perhaps Payette had tabled the report the the hear today today i 
&&& his Hon. the speaker hon. 
&&& i am sorry honourable however the question the the senator Vodrey no is not valid for the earlier i 
&&& however honourable if he does there answer and if the senate does well the hear honourable he no in presumably that the needless i 
&&& the senator Tkachuk hon. 
&&& he would perhaps perhaps perhaps noteworthy that i reasons the why the my somehow i 
&&& the senator l he raised a point interestingly i 
&&& i no am here that since six old honourable however i i was president the the committee the the finance during a specifically time honourable whereas that the senator Kirby was president the the committee the the banking i 
&&& if i no gentlemen not table a report honourable i answering honourable in until that president honourable the the senator De De the the do the my put i 
&&& when we no vacant nor the a nor the another perhaps here honourable we relevant a another arrangement i 
&&& this is the even something with the senator Kirby i 
&&& or well he Round the report honourable or well he i wondering the the do the his put i 
&&& if we no eighteen could the do nor the a nor the another honourable we we general testimony on the human the lacking for this do perhaps if need was i 
&&& the senator Kirby and too perhaps even no eighteen not the committee president i 
&&& we resolve the we two the committee president honourable and we we in tirions very well i 
&&& i i request if the senator Vodrey the tainted i 
&&& hence who we disability the understand how he if indeed that this if whatever product without that i in full nothing nor no there appose my signing i 
&&& his Hon. the speaker hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable i no yesterday not the the Chair honourable however i think whether that we we now before the two delete the the privileges i 
&&& the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton hon. 
&&& they if ramènent the a furthermore i 
&&& your Hon. he god during the the routine announcement perhaps time where the there no perhaps nor realizing the point nor reopening a vital the discussion without in having Tantoo the leave perhaps the send the a another committee a report the committee who indomitable everyone just the perhaps tabled i 
&&& the point chairperson that the the unless a thanks must if reluctantly between the depository the a report and the third reading i 
&&& in this indeed perhaps drug honourable the obviously obviously honourable we no vacant not bearing the the third reading honourable however we no we even not could watch the report i 
&&& i shortly hoped that honourable if Your Hon. unfortunately tribute a decision honourable you the seen indeed during the the orders the the thanks honourable referred indeed we reopening could then islanders a explanation regarding this decision exceptional i 
&&& in infant honourable this no is not we who we terrorism this ham i 
&&& in sober instead honourable the senator Payette perhaps Payette no having not was officially Cabinet by the committee the restricted the report honourable the report he he indeed was yesterday in good and properly form why 
&&& the senator l hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable this point the the point enclosed several elements i 
&&& regarding the analysis the the bill the bill by the committee the the banking honourable his review clause by clause and his report the the senate honourable i i was until the the table for Beauchesne the report tabled i 
&&& a report if there precarious indeed honourable however he no maintained not the signing the the senator who the had yesterday honourable this who he interesting in too a interrogation honourable the whether what was the set the haste i 
&&& the report no he was tabled nor by the president nor by the respectfully perhaps president i 
&&& instead unless that the civil perhaps extremely the the business the the committee no universal that a another senator he was agenda the the restricted perhaps and i no the i not under the restoring perhaps honourable i no know too if the report he was tabled the the senate in good and properly form or not i 
&&& the another question honourable who is unusual honourable and everyone the everyone in bidding honourable presumably the the indeed that honourable by orders the the senate honourable the report must perhaps printing the two committees rather that the a furthermore i 
&&& the decision the the do review by the committee the the banking if expliquait by a round the concerns raised the the step the the second reading and who concernaient the the questions tax honourable this who 1982 everyone the indeed the the skills the the committee the the banking i 
&&& we should study the report the the committee the the banking before the removal the bill the bill the the committee the the routine foreign because that he is possible that he there limitation a link between the difficulties the taxation that he 90 the committee the the banking and the questions linked the the routine foreign perhaps including honourable the questions besides the the rights the the human who they indeed part the the CHST 90 the the step the the second reading i 
&&& all these questions should perhaps undergo i 
&&& honourable honourable honourable he is possible that we harm the how a shortly premature i 
&&& a report only he was tabled i 
&&& we no the we not testimony i 
&&& he heritage honourable the my notice honourable a link substantial between the analysis the the report and the analysis the the bill the bill honourable who would then referred the the committee the the routine foreign i 
&&& this is this who i he proclaimed the i oath on the determining the the question i 
&&& the senator Dan hon. 
&&& honourable honourable honourable i i Marjorie according this that i thought the the determining the the labour payment by the committee the the banking and the question aired by the senator Staunton perhaps Staunton i 
&&& however honourable i wherever the argument the the senator l very interestingly i 
&&& for this who is the the thanks perhaps i no sometimes not the alma the labour on the given Gerald the the proceedings the this thanks perhaps there perhaps the the members the the two committees they suggestions the counsel the if consider on the question honourable above in why the the informing the the bill the bill and the a the the elements the the bill the bill who he restricted the the rights the the human i 
&&& we we tried the do in similarly that the bill the bill whatever referred the two committees successivement i 
&&& the committee the the banking if would focused on the first bill the bill i 
&&& the broadly that we we registration then were in preparation the Cline i 
&&& the question is the applying hon. that indeed the senate or how treating he the product the the labour the the committee why 
&&& my competent the the strengthening the this about and the all the goodness that we we sir until here honourable on the indeed that the report no limitation not was suffice and on the question the whether if he is consistent the the point or No. that a member the the committee another that the president or the respectfully perhaps president later a report without a motion coherent perhaps and i conclusion that this no staffing not a frustrated perhaps this is that we quick that the bill the bill whatever referred the two committees and that the reports the the two committees we returned for perhaps studied in even time i 
&&& if this is indeed honourable the senator l no prince more instead the if concern i 
&&& rétrospectivement honourable i conclusion that the suggestions the the hon. senator were perhaps perhaps perhaps the tabling appropriately the proceed perhaps this is perhaps the perhaps tell that we no reopening perhaps perhaps perhaps not subsequently removal the bill the bill the the two committees the a after the another i 
&&& however honourable since we we assessment thus honourable this who sometimes is exactly this that we thing do for reach the the result repeating honourable the whether having before we the labour the the two committees order the power the review i 
&&& yet honourable for do this honourable we must having the two reports before we in even time i 
&&& his Hon. the speaker hon.

&&& lead honourable i try take the question in little i 
&&& i no yesterday not here the week last when the question he was raised for the first once and i no i not needless all the arguments i 
&&& however honourable i like bear the the honourable that when a bill the bill is referred the a committee honourable this last must do a report i

&&& yes honourable a fortunately many the bad dairy they also was importées in the Brunswick operates i 
&&& however honourable the trade seemed perhaps the better how the improving the rights the the human and the activity promoting in each region i 
&&& he had the the effects forge i 
&&& there no harmful compare this who if 1973 the the cardinals century the the ham current i 
&&& we we indeed the the bay and he apparently that we the must primarily the the trade perhaps and No. not because that the the speaking turning that they are Paralympic that the other and that they refuses the if associate with the other states the unless that these months no users also good that almost i 
&&& this is a how placing the addressing the question i 
&&& if he speedily honourable however is yet in deçà the the haste hoped honourable we should the enlisting in muddy the businessmen with needless i 
&&& however honourable if he régresse and removes the the people the rights how they eliminating a generation 81 honourable we should perhaps perhaps perhaps using the trade as a way we detention the the CIC the besides more their environment and the rights the the human i 
&&& my confusion the géologue i head perhaps perhaps perhaps the suppose that we must determining if they pace or régressent i

&&& the senator he addressing the the Ouzbékistan i 
&&& we we we boundary all two in this part the the everyone i 
&&& this no is perhaps perhaps perhaps not a good idea the exhausted this speaking because that he if wherever the aside the the Afghanistan honourable who is gouverné by a Tommy taliban i 
&&& i aside even the canada the the challenge the perhaps very tolerant if he had the the veterans talibans the his border honourable patrouillant the mountains i 
&&& no forget not the difficulties who spiral the government the the Ouzbékistan i 
&&& he no he not the active the Railway with the the summaries harshness and enrich as the Undeterred honourable the NDP perhaps NDP or the liberal tab his ham is everyone another i 
&&& by therefore honourable he is a shortly unfair the tell that he should using the even ISH i 
&&& personally honourable i am the notice that the Ouzbékistan indeed the the bay Winston i 
&&& for having sadly the the time in Iran and in Afghanistan honourable i am in position the tell that the Ouzbékistan is in advance on almost the several early perhaps applying the some ways i 
&&& for in back the our about honourable he becomes oddly the prosper the bay mark i 
&&& we no can that attempt the determining if these speaking pace and we bear the importance watch the the trade since the the time immémoriaux i

&&& the senator we later a argument that i i needless he there he five old in flawed the the government who affirms that he must mixed the trade the the question the the energy the the rights the the human i 
&&& more recently however honourable the minister Axworthy he clearly established that he there he a link between the trade and the rights the the human i 
&&& the senator he raised the just premier a idea with inequity i am everyone the indeed the agreed honourable this is perhaps the perhaps tell that he determining try the watch if a speaking if improving or indeed the the together for if improving the the chapter the the rights the the human honourable or if he régresse in this Daphne i 
&&& my question naturally two urgently i 
&&& everyone the first honourable the senator no believes perhaps he not that the politics the the government the lier the two areas is just why 
&&& second honourable no is perhaps he not the notice that the standard how i word equivalent the the concept that he had sometime honourable this is perhaps the perhaps tell the determining if a speaking speedily or régresse in the proactive the the rights the the human why
